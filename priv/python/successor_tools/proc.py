"""Owned process groups: identify one, probe it, end it, report what happened.

The kernel's job supervision and the supervisor's checked signal helper both run
this ladder, so the two layers agree on what "terminated" means. A group is live
only while it holds a member we can still signal; a reaped leader or a group of
non-running (zombie) members is not work.
